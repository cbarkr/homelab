# Homelab

Defines the specifications and configurations for services running in my homelab

## Goals

- Services should be run as rootless (Podman) containers
- Free and open-source software (FOSS) should always be the first choice
- Deploying services to a new environment should be fast and easy (using automated methods)

## Structure

- `bin`: Scripts and executables
- `etc`: Configuration files for system services
- `services`: Service definitions
